Files in 'stat/*.txt are post-processing results made via the program MGmapper_classify.pl

The files positive.* are those passing the MGmapper_classify.pl filtering criteria):
MGmapper_classify.pl -i ../misc/stat.Bacteria.annot -c strain (input are paired-end reads)

MGmapper_classify.pl -i ../misc/stat.Bacteria.annot -s -c strain (input are single-end reads)

Default parameters for MGmapper_classify.pl are:

-a 0.01 (abundance of at least 0.01%)
-r 0.005 (readCountUniq/readCount)
-m 0.01 (maximum mismatch ratio nucleotides/mismatched_nucleotides, where mismatch_nucleotides are number of changes need to make a read match the reference sequence, also known as the edit_distance)
-n 10 (minimum number of mapped reads)#
# At strain and species level -r 0.05 should be used
# At all other levels i.e. genus phylum etc -r 0 should be used i.e. uniq read count ratio is not used
#
-g 0 (minimum coverage)
-c strain (collapse at clade levels = strain

-s (single-end reads, effecting the abundance calculation. if -s is not defined then abundance is divided by 2 due to pair-end reads)
Possible clades are: superfamily, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species and strain
Also, the data from different databases can be collapsed via option -d

A special file is 'abundance.databases.txt' which shows read aboundance for all databases
Percentages are calculated based on reads available after removing those that map to PhiX (notPhiX). notPhiX count is set
Unmapped reads is calculated only on runs in Bestmode.

All files are combined into two excel workbook named 'Sample.xlsx' and 'Sample.negative.xlsx', where the latter includes 
hits at strain and species level that did NOT pass the filters when running MGmapper_classify.pl
